    "\n",
    "The General Linear Model (GLM) is a useful framework for comparing how several variables affect different continuous variables. GLM is the foundation for several statistical tests, including ANOVA, ANCOVA and regression analysis. GLM provides a way to model dependent variables that have non-normal distributions and allows for the incorporation of predictor variables that are not Normally distributed. The GLM allows us to summarize a wide variety of research outcomes. The generalized linear model(GLM) generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value¹. \n"

The likelihood ratio test is a more powerful test than the p-value, but it is also more computationally demanding.

A large difference in the likelihoods indicates that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true, and the predictor is therefore likely to be significant.\n",

    "Bagging, also known as bootstrap aggregating, is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple versions of a model, called **base learners**, to make predictions.
